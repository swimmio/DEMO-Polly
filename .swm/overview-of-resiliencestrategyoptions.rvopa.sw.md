# What is ResilienceStrategyOptions

`ResilienceStrategyOptions` is an abstract class that represents the options associated with an individual resilience strategy in the Polly library. It is used to define the name of the strategy, which uniquely identifies a particular instance of a specific strategy and is included in the telemetry produced by the individual resilience strategies.

# Variables and functions

The `Name` property is a string that gets or sets the name of the strategy. This name uniquely identifies a particular instance of a specific strategy and is also included in the telemetry that is produced by the individual resilience strategies.

```c#
    public string? Name { get; set; }
```

# Usage example

`EmptyOptions` is an example of a class that extends `ResilienceStrategyOptions`. It is a sealed class that does not have any additional properties or methods. It is used as a default instance when no specific options are provided for a resilience strategy.

```c#
    internal sealed class EmptyOptions : ResilienceStrategyOptions
    {
        public static readonly EmptyOptions Instance = new();
    }
```
