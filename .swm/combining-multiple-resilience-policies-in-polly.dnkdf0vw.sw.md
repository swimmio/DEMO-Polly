# How to chain resilience policies

The `ResiliencePipelineSyncPolicy` class is used to chain resilience policies together. The `_pipeline` field holds the resilience pipeline, which is a sequence of resilience strategies. The `Execute` method is used to execute the resilience pipeline.

```c#
internal sealed class ResiliencePipelineSyncPolicy : Policy
{
    private readonly ResiliencePipeline _pipeline;

    public ResiliencePipelineSyncPolicy(ResiliencePipeline strategy) => _pipeline = strategy;

    protected override void Implementation(Action<Context, CancellationToken> action, Context context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var resilienceContext = ResilienceContextFactory.Create(
            context,
            cancellationToken,
            true,
            out var oldProperties);

        try
        {
            _pipeline.Execute(
                static (context, state) =>
                {
                    state.action(state.context, context.CancellationToken);
                },
```

# Examples of chaining resilience policies

Here is an example of how to chain resilience policies together. The `ResiliencePipelineBuilder` is used to add strategies to the pipeline. In this case, a timeout strategy is added to the pipeline.

```c#
        ResiliencePipeline pipeline = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
            .AddTimeout(new TimeoutStrategyOptions
            {
                Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)
            })
            .Build();

        #endregion
```
