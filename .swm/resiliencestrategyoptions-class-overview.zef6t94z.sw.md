# What is ResilienceStrategyOptions

`ResilienceStrategyOptions` is an abstract class that provides a base for options associated with individual resilience strategies in the Polly library. It is used to define common properties that are shared across different resilience strategies.

# Variables and functions

The `Name` variable is used to store the name of the strategy. This name uniquely identifies a particular instance of a specific strategy and is also included in the telemetry that is produced by the individual resilience strategies.

```c#
    public string? Name { get; set; }
```

# Usage example

`HedgingStrategyOptions` is an example of a class that extends `ResilienceStrategyOptions`. It defines additional properties specific to the hedging strategy, such as `Delay`, `MaxHedgedAttempts`, `ShouldHandle`, `ActionGenerator`, `DelayGenerator`, and `OnHedging`. These properties control the behavior of the hedging strategy, such as the maximum waiting time before spawning a new hedged action, the maximum number of hedged actions to use, and the conditions under which the hedging should be executed.

```c#
public class HedgingStrategyOptions<TResult> : ResilienceStrategyOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="HedgingStrategyOptions{TResult}"/> class.
    /// </summary>
    public HedgingStrategyOptions() => Name = HedgingConstants.DefaultName;

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the maximum waiting time before spawning a new hedged action.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// You can use <see cref="TimeSpan.Zero"/> to create all hedged actions (value of <see cref="MaxHedgedAttempts"/>) at once
    /// or <see cref="System.Threading.Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan"/> to force the hedging strategy to never create new action before the old one is finished.
    /// <para> If you want a greater control over hedging delay customization use <see cref="DelayGenerator"/>.</para>
    /// </remarks>
    /// <value>
    /// The default value is 2 seconds.
    /// </value>
    public TimeSpan Delay { get; set; } = HedgingConstants.DefaultHedgingDelay;

    /// <summary>
```
