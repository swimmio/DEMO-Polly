# What is NoOp and where is it implemented

NoOp is a method in the `Policy` class that builds a NoOp `Policy` that will execute without any custom behavior. It is implemented in the `NoOpSyntax.cs` file.

```c#
    /// <summary>
    /// Builds a NoOp <see cref="Policy"/> that will execute without any custom behavior.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>The policy instance.</returns>
    public static NoOpPolicy NoOp() => new();
```

# Main classes/functions/files related to NoOp

The `NoOpPolicy` class is a no op policy that can be applied to delegates. It uses the `NoOpEngine` for its implementation.

```c#
/// <summary>
/// A no op policy that can be applied to delegates.
/// </summary>
public class NoOpPolicy : Policy, INoOpPolicy
{
    internal NoOpPolicy()
    {
    }

    /// <inheritdoc/>
    [DebuggerStepThrough]
    protected override TResult Implementation<TResult>(Func<Context, CancellationToken, TResult> action, Context context, CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
        NoOpEngine.Implementation(action, context, cancellationToken);
}
```
