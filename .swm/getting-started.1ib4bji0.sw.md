# Purpose and Main Functionalities of the Repo

DEMO-Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library. It allows developers to express resilience strategies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Hedging, Timeout, Rate Limiter, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner. It provides NuGet packages for core abstractions and built-in strategies, telemetry and dependency injection support, integration with rate limiting APIs, testing support for Polly libraries, and a legacy API for versions before v8.

# Important Documents to Read

The `README.md` file provides a comprehensive overview of the repo, including its purpose, main functionalities, and how to get started. It also provides links to the documentation for each resilience strategy. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file provides guidelines on how to contribute to the repo, including the GitHub workflow, code of conduct, and the .NET Foundation Contributor License Agreement.

# Running and Debugging the Repo

The `README.md` file provides a quick start guide on how to use Polly. It includes instructions on how to add the Polly.Core package to your project, how to create a `ResiliencePipeline` using the `ResiliencePipelineBuilder` class, and how to execute the pipeline asynchronously. It also provides examples of how to define resilience pipelines using `IServiceCollection`.

# Contributing to the Repo

Contributors are asked to branch from the head of the default branch when developing contributions. They are also asked to abide by the .NET Foundation's Code of Conduct and to review and sign the .NET Foundation Contributor License Agreement. The repo also has a Slack channel for easier real-time discussion of ideas and the general direction of Polly.
